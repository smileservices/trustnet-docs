# 1. Intro

TrustNet.app offers a public API for integrating user authentication, Reviews API and Verifications API with OIDC (open id connect) into client applications.
An example of implementing and using the API is [available here](https://oidc-client.smileservices.dev).


## * OIDC for users authentication & easy onboarding 

* easily implement user system with social sign-in 
* outsource the security of users private data
* get access to pre-verified users contacts, making onboarding a breeze

## * Reviews/recommendations API

* access users existing recommendations/reviews
* outsource review system for your users
* ask for recommendations on behalf of a user
* submit new recommendation on behalf of a user

## * Verifications API

* outsource verifying & holding users sensitive data
* ask an user to verify a contact (email or phone)
* ask an user to verify his identity by a range of specific documents
