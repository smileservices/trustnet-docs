# 2. New Client Account

Integrating requires creating an user account on TrustNet.app then creating an OIDC client.

## * New User Account

* Go to [the authentication page](https://auth.trustnet.app/auth) and sign in with either socials or user/pass or passkeys. The easiest is to use social authentication. 
* Next, you will be redirected to create a new persona.
* Create a new persona by selecting name attributes such as `alias` or `givenName` or `familyName` then you will be redirected to the user dashboard.

## * New OIDC Client

* In the left sidebar, select "Account" to be redirected to account admin.
* While in account admin, select "OIDC Clients" from the left sidebar. A pop-up will appear that lists existing OIDC clients associated with your account.
* Click "New Client" and the form will appear.
* Complete the form and click submit, then save the `client id` and `client secret` in a safe place.
