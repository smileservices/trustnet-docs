## * Contracts

Contract is modeling an agreement between two or more actual people which forms the basis for any relation. The contract
has an object, a start date, a duration.

## * Contract Parties

Parties in a contract are at least two actual persons thus the contract parties are always linked directly to an
account. Publicly, the relation between the account and the contract is the persona.

## * Reviews/Recommendations

Each party involved in a contract can leave only one recommendation to another party.
